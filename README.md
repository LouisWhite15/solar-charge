# ‚ö° SolarCharge

SolarCharge is a small self-hosted application designed to run on an always-on device. It integrates with your solar inverter and Tesla to manage EV charging intelligently ‚Äî starting and stopping charge sessions based on your solar PV generation.

## üßæ Overview

The system monitors your solar generation and charges your Tesla only when there‚Äôs surplus power available, minimizing grid draw and saving you money. The solution is completely self-hosted so your data isn't being sent anywhere and is all contained within your local network.

## ‚ú® Features

- Automatically starts Tesla charging when excess PV generation exceeds a defined threshold  
- Stops charging when solar generation falls below the threshold  
- Compatible with common solar inverters (see supported list)  
- Support for notifications through Telegram  
- Fully self-hosted solution  
- Lightweight and easy to run on a Raspberry Pi  

## üõ† Requirements

- Raspberry Pi (or other always-on device)  
- Tesla account with API access  
- Solar inverter with network-accessible real-time data  

## üì¶ Installation

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

If you plan on using the Telegram bot functionality to provide notifications, then you'll need to get a Bot Token for your Telegram Bot. Follow the instructions [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#botfather) to get started.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

- Copy the `docker-compose.yaml` from the `src` directory  
- Replace the `Telegram__BotToken` environment variable in the `solar-charge-telegram` service with the Bot Token you retrieved above  
- Send the message `/start` to the Telegram Bot. This will configure the bot to use that chat for future communications  
- Navigate to `http://<IP_ADDRESS>:5000` and follow the instructions to log in to your Tesla account  
  - Note: This uses Tesla's official authentication. SolarCharge never sees your Tesla credentials
